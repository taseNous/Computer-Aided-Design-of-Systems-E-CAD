Electrical computer-aided design (ECAD) software systems are used to design and develop electronic systems 
such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs). ECAD software enables electrical engineers 
to create and modify diagrams and layouts including 2D and 3D models. ECAD is also known as electronic design automation (EDA).

It's main features are:
- Schematic Capture
- PCB Layout
- Simulation and Analysis
- Component Libraries
- Design Rule Checking (DRC)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) Generation
- Manufacturing Outputs

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is commonly used for designing and verifying 
digital circuits and systems, such as microprocessors, memory chips, and communication devices. Verilog allows engineers to describe 
the behavior and structure of electronic circuits at various levels of abstraction, from high-level system design down to gate-level descriptions.
