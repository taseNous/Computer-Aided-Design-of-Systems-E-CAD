Electrical computer-aided design (ECAD) software systems are used to design and develop electronic systems 
such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs). ECAD software enables electrical engineers 
to create and modify diagrams and layouts including 2D and 3D models. ECAD is also known as electronic design automation (EDA).

It's main features are:
- Schematic Capture (create and edit electronic circuit diagrams)
- PCB Layout (physical layout of printed circuit boards)
- Simulation and Analysis (tools for simulating the behavior of electronic circuits)
- Component Libraries (libraries of electronic components with associated data)
- Design Rule Checking (DRC) (Ensures that the design adheres to specific rules and constraints)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) Generation (list of all components required for the design)
- Manufacturing Outputs (files necessary for manufacturing the PCB)

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is commonly used for designing and verifying 
digital circuits and systems, such as microprocessors, memory chips, and communication devices. Verilog allows engineers to describe 
the behavior and structure of electronic circuits at various levels of abstraction, from high-level system design down to gate-level descriptions.

It's main features are:
- Behavioral Modeling (allows to describe the functionality of a digital system using high-level constructs)
- Dataflow Modeling (describes how data flows through the system)
- Structural Modeling (uses interconnected components or modules, reflecting the actual hardware structure)
- Gate-Level Modeling (describes the circuit in terms of logic gates and their interconnections)
- Concurrency (concurrent execution of statementsessential for modeling the parallel nature of hardware operations)
- Testbenches (simulate and verify the design)
- Synthesis (can be synthesized into actual hardware, such as FPGA or ASIC)
- Standardization (Verilog is standardized by the IEEE)
